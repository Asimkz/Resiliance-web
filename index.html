                    <p class="txt-2 mx-lg-5 my-lg-2 mx-md-0">TM is an easy-to-learn, enjoyable-to-practice mental
                        technique for deep
                        relaxation
                        and
                        stress-reduction that has been successfully offered in medical schools, academic and VA
                        medical
                        centers, hospitals, military academies, substance abuse centers, prisons, and other
                        settings. The TM
                        technique is practiced for 15-20 minutes twice a day. To date, more than ten million people
                        of all
                        ages, nationalities, and religions have learned the technique.</p>
                    <p class="txt-2 mx-lg-5 my-lg-2 mx-md-0">
                        TM practice produces a unique neurophysiological state that combines deep metabolic rest
                        with
                        heightened mental alertness. This state of deep relaxation, which researchers have termed
                        "restful
                        alertness," is a potent antidote to stress. Hundreds of peer-reviewed published studies on
                        TM have
                        documented improvements in a wide variety of stress-related disorders, as well as
                        significant
                        improvements in cognitive function and overall health and well-being. The National
                        Institutes of
                        Health and the Department of Defense have awarded nearly $30 million in grant support for
                        research on TM

                        An estimated one million veterans suffer from the nightmare of
                        post-traumatic stress (PTS), and that includes more than 270,000
                        Vietnam war veterans. Worse, less than 20% of these veterans will
                        receive adequate care due to lack of effective treatments, fear of stigma or
                        insufficient government resources. Half of those won't receive any care at all.
                        Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), two of the
                        Veterans Administration (VA) first line interventions for PTS, are not effective for
                        between one-half and two-thirds of patients. Left untreated, PTS cripples the
                        ability to function and places veterans at great risk for violent and
                        self-destructive behavior, including:

                        veterans,
                        active-duty
                        personnel and military families in TM. One of our most successful partnerships
                        has been with the Bronx VA Resilience and Wellness Center (RWC). The RWC is an
                        innovative program focused on suicide prevention. The RWC targets vulnerable
                        veterans by augmenting traditional treatments with complementary and
                        integrative health interventions. DLF and TM have been part of the RWC since its
                        inception in October 2018 and over 100 high-risk veterans have learned TM.
                        Multi-year program partnerships also include VA hospitals nationwide; National
                        Defense University in Washington, DC; Boulder Crest Retreat Centers; UCLA
                        Veterans Family Wellness Center; EOD Warrior Foundation; residential substance
                        abuse treatments centers in New York City; City University of New York Office of
                        Veterans; numerous military bases, including Ft. Bragg, Ft. Gordon, Ft. Belvoir, and
                        Ft. Hamilton; and the New York City Veterans Mental Health Coalition.

                        Tragically in the time it takes to read this, another veteran will fall from the
                        ranks. This national tragedy is compounded by the fact that such acts
                        cause lifelong harm to family members and co-workers—and directly
                        challenge the military's ethos: "No one left behind." Clearly these patriots who
                        choose to release their pain through suicide rather than confront it have been
                        "left behind." And despite the best efforts of the Veterans Administration,
                        including untold billions of dollars allocated to the treatment of PTS and the
                        reduction of suicide ideation, the number of veterans taking their own lives
                        continues to grow.

                        underserved children, veterans with PTS, and women survivors of violence and
                        assault. Extensive research, including randomized controlled trials, has
                        documented the benefits of the Transcendental Meditation technique for
                        reducing symptoms of PTS and suicidal ideation, as well as decreasing stress,
                        anxiety, depression, substance use disorder, and heart disease; improving brain
                        and cognitive functioning; and raising performance. </p>

                        veterans with PTS in 2022. Support for the project came from the VA
                        Deputy Undersecretary for Health, Carolyn Clancy, Executive Director of the
                        National Center for PTSD, Paula Schnurr, and National Director Of the VA's

                        effective as a first line treatment for PTS. Secondary outcomes will include
                        depression, suicidal ideation, alcohol craving/usage, sleep quality and quality Of
                        life. The 9-site study will take place at VA medical centers and research
                        universities around the U.S. with approximately 450 subjects. The goal Of the
                        study is to secure long-term government funding for veterans with PTSD

                        The primary outcome measure in this clinical trial will be the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale
                        (CAPS) for DSM-5. Secondary outcome measures will include the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating
                        Scale, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)-5, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 for
                        depression, Insomnia Sleep Index, Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) interview of alcohol consumption

                        cost-saving value of the TM program in the treatment of PTSD.

                                The impact of this proposed study will be substantial. The research will be used to
                                secure
                                government approval for the implementation of TM as a treatment option in VA healthcare
                                and
                                other military settings. The availability of an alternative and evidence-based PTS
                                therapy will benefit
                                patients by offering a greater range of treatment options and by serving as a secondary
                                modality
                                for those not responding to prior therapy.
                                In particular, because TM is a non-trauma focused treatment, it is often preferred to
                                other existing
                                treatments for PTS therapies that involve confronting anxiety-provoking thoughts and
                                stimuli. TM is
                                relatively low cost and provides a life-long tool for promoting mental and physical
                                health. Other
                                benefits of TM include being less emotionally demanding for patients than other PTS
                                therapies,
                                producing noticeable benefits within the first month of practice, and being a treatment
                                that is more
                                self-empowering to veterans through regular daily home practice.

                        active
